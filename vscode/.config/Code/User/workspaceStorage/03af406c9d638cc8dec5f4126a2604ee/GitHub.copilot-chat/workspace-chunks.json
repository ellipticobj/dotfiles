For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n

Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n...\n```","range":{"startLineNumber":108,"startColumn":0,"endLineNumber":129,"endColumn":0},"embedding":[-0.053100586,0.028869629,0.014678955,-0.030700684,0.062927246,-0.023101807,-0.039367676,-0.041015625,-0.026947021,0.016540527,0.03604126,-0.015625,-0.010253906,0.026947021,0.019500732,0.012390137,0.010437012,-0.05316162,0.0046691895,-0.022003174,0.0843811,0.013305664,-0.048187256,0.03488159,-0.0010375977,-0.05718994,-0.083343506,-0.0074157715,0.025177002,0.021575928,-0.044677734,-0.038146973,-0.007965088,0.046661377,0.009063721,-0.070251465,0.036254883,-0.029754639,0.07748413,-0.07513428,-0.038879395,-0.06906128,-0.015380859,-0.005706787,-0.0592041,0.0066223145,-0.012817383,-0.033569336,0.0009765625,0.0211792,-0.071777344,-0.05050659,0.07797241,0.005065918,-0.025756836,0.02432251,-0.033081055,0.022247314,0.030975342,-0.0368042,-0.0022277832,0.041931152,-0.108551025,-0.035461426,-0.09750366,0.042877197,-0.018432617,0.03668213,-0.021118164,0.013122559,0.009643555,0.046722412,-0.05895996,-0.02017212,0.017791748,0.046081543,-0.054138184,0.107177734,-0.009216309,-0.013000488,0.0119018555,0.01940918,-0.06524658,-0.039489746,-0.070007324,-0.000030517578,-0.043518066,0.07165527,-0.025817871,-0.10977173,-0.08087158,0.011505127,-0.02243042,0.06417847,0.010528564,0.0040283203,-0.055664062,0.024963379,-0.053344727,0.0178833,0.04522705,-0.036102295,-0.027160645,-0.05807495,0.07348633,0.023590088,0.06555176,-0.013000488,-0.051696777,-0.036743164,-0.075805664,0.050994873,0.05444336,0.010803223,0.023834229,-0.010650635,0.052124023,-0.014343262,-0.018737793,-0.03866577,-0.020355225,-0.015686035,0.030273438,-0.07696533,0.051727295,0.023071289,0.053253174,0.008972168,-0.0022888184,-0.031921387,0.052124023,-0.03213501,0.019012451,-0.02645874,-0.043914795,0.010437012,-0.037902832,0.028076172,-0.041107178,0.04257202,-0.043060303,-0.074645996,-0.02645874,0.033721924,-0.028656006,-0.010101318,-0.080963135,0.045684814,-0.062194824,0.039489746,0.076660156,0.031555176,-0.0072021484,0.01083374,-0.03149414,-0.07901001,0.06085205,0.05517578,-0.012878418,-0.01828003,0.0021362305,0.015808105,0.044433594,0.043273926,0.0054626465,0.029846191,0.00793457,-0.005340576,-0.049835205,0.09286499,-0.006866455,-0.04309082,-0.03652954,-0.08370972,0.060302734,-0.029144287,-0.009765625,-0.04232788,0.010314941,-0.048309326,-0.038909912,0.019470215,-0.04055786,-0.08822632,0.013214111,-0.06237793,-0.048431396,0.03189087,-0.00793457,-0.024627686,-0.036254883,0.034332275,0.0035705566,-0.00091552734,-0.018829346,0.010070801,0.014953613,-0.043914795,0.059692383,-0.00894165,0.013061523,0.034851074,0.088653564,0.010864258,-0.070251465,-0.08807373,-0.041870117,0.0178833,-0.044006348,-0.0079956055,-0.05050659,0.0013122559,0.014892578,0.0028381348,-0.044036865,-0.023773193,-0.008575439,0.049987793,0.011291504,-0.008758545,0.009552002,0.0690918,0.066101074,0.042510986,0.04135132,0.038360596,-0.029724121,-0.055877686,0.024749756,-0.05831909,0.04925537,0.00076293945,-0.03463745,-0.080596924,-0.0803833,0.00012207031,-0.06237793,-0.046661377,-0.019897461,-0.0012817383,-0.04788208,-0.018981934,0.02041626,-0.033050537,0,-0.01071167,-0.019500732,-0.027618408,-0.043518066,0.013458252,0.07980347,0.038635254,0.09576416,-0.027252197,-0.002532959,-0.0072631836,0.011474609,0.0043029785,0.058929443,-0.014099121,-0.083343506,-0.06976318,-0.024993896,-0.02355957,-0.03829956,0.051116943,0.045806885,0.055358887,0.04425049,-0.022857666,0.039367676,0.017303467,0.063568115,-0.0082092285,-0.037597656,-0.04425049,0.018829346,0.10470581,0.07522583,-0.027526855,-0.07537842,0.022064209,0.029510498,0.044067383,-0.039642334,0.03277588,-0.027709961,0.058135986,0.042053223,-0.016845703,0.031158447,-0.011993408,0.016571045,-0.08496094,0.001953125,0.01159668,0.13787842,0.018127441,-0.009735107,0.036499023,0.033935547,0.014312744,-0.02722168,-0.0211792,-0.04724121,0.043640137,0.068115234,0.0440979,-0.04156494,-0.03765869,0.018066406,-0.09738159,-0.042541504,-0.0011901855,-0.04498291,-0.060302734,0.020202637,0.012969971,-0.0015563965,0.0026550293,0.052886963,0.024932861,0.08401489,-0.03414917,0.01272583,0.11065674,-0.0050964355,-0.012908936,-0.025390625,-0.029846191,0.051635742,-0.00015258789,-0.040740967,-0.017547607,0.019683838,-0.061462402,-0.046691895,0.10324097,0.018066406,0.030944824,0.011932373,-0.03137207,-0.061828613,0.07537842,0.06277466,-0.041168213,-0.02041626,0.0105896,0.12597656,0.032165527,-0.0008239746,-0.04840088,0.0072631836,0.012054443,-0.021270752,-0.0076904297,0.049560547,-0.067596436,-0.057769775,0.010864258,-0.059295654,-0.02166748,0.07330322,-0.010986328,-0.036132812,-0.0005493164,-0.0051879883,-0.023956299,-0.009521484,0.0062561035,0.090545654,0.013366699,-0.04309082,-0.043060303,-0.01889038,-0.013061523,-0.008270264,0.011230469,-0.0335083,-0.01739502,0.017913818,0.050811768,-0.032592773,-0.018310547,0.057495117,-0.02407837,-0.007080078,0.0031433105,-0.024353027,0.023132324,0.09170532,-0.022735596,-0.020050049,-0.0046081543,0.048034668,0.008758545,0.061767578,
