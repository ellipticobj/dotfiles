# Preferences
- The user prefers structs to be defined in models.rs and wants App structs renamed to AppState structs.
- The user prefers using specific getter methods like backend::get::playlists() rather than accessing the entire state with backend::get::state().

# Functionality
- The trackscont should display songs from the current playlist, not from a separate tracks vector in AppState.
