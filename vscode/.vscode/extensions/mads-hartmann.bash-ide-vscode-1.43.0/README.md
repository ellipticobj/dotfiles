Visual Studio Code extension utilizing the [Bash Language Server](https://github.com/bash-lsp/bash-language-server/blob/HEAD/bash-lsp) and integrating with [explainshell][explainshell], [shellcheck][shellcheck] and [shfmt][shfmt].

We recommend that you [install shellcheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck#installing) to enable linting and [install shfmt](https://github.com/mvdan/sh?tab=readme-ov-file#shfmt) to enable formatting.

## Configuration

To get documentation for flags on hover (thanks to explainshell), run a explainshell server and update your VS Code settings:

```
    "bashIde.explainshellEndpoint": "http://localhost:5000",
```

For security reasons, it defaults to `""`, which disables explainshell integration. When set, this extension will send requests to the endpoint and displays documentation for flags. We recommend using a local Docker image (see https://github.com/bash-lsp/bash-language-server/issues/180).
